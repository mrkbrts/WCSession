# WCSession - transferUserInfo() ⌚

Trying to find the easiest way of implementing WCSession.transferUserInfo() and WCSession.sendMessage().

# Important ❗

It seems like that XCode 11.x.x has a bug that prevents .transferUserInfo() from running on a WatchOS simulator. To avoid that, and get this funcion working, you need to run this on a phyisical device.
